# NgRx Data

This project demonstrates the integration of NgPrime, NgRx (using standalone components), and NgRx Data with an ExpressJS backend. The focus is on exploring how to configure NgRx with standalone components, which can be challenging due to the lack of comprehensive tutorials on the subject.

## Key Features
- **NgPrime**: A UI component library for Angular applications.
- **NgRx with Standalone Components**: Learn how to integrate NgRx into Angular standalone components, which are a newer approach in Angular.
- **NgRx Data**: Simplified entity data management within NgRx.
- **ExpressJS Backend**: A simple backend built using ExpressJS to manage server-side logic.

## Why this project?
Finding a detailed tutorial that showcases how to use NgRx with standalone components can be difficult. This repository provides an example of how to configure NgRx effectively in this context, offering insight into setting up a reactive architecture with NgRx Data for state management.

## How to Run
1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
2. Run the Frontend(obligatory):
